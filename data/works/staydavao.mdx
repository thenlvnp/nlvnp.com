### What i learned

This project has taught me big lessons, One of those is being able to prepare for the project. Preparation is key when embarking on these types of projects. from preparing assets to properly evaluating the design of the product. Another lesson is being able to be consistent in development whether it is using `const` or `let` in declaring variables or enforcing proper indentation whithin the codebase or properly organizing files, all of these small things when taken into consideration can be a hude help.

Another lesson that this project taught me is to be adaptable and flexible, since this project is very volatile in terms of designs and the logic behind it I learned to be able to change course and execute in a short period of time. and lasty it taught me the value of teamwork and communication, albeit a small team we still had problems in terms of proper practices in building interfaces and being able to execute basic accessibility. this project made me realize that great products that we use and value are made by people who put so much care and value to it more.

## Conclusion

Our agency had big plans to leverage more than just real estate seeing as though that there is no clear competiotion that is based around real estate and is locally scoped within davao city, or within mindanao.Unfortunately the development of was halted due to COVID-19 Pandemic.
